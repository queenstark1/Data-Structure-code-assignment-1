# Data Structures Implementation in Python

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental data structures using Python.  
It includes examples of both linear and non-linear data structures along with basic operations for each.

## Implemented Data Structures

### 1. Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out)
- **Description:** A collection where the last element added is the first to be removed.  
- **Operations:** `push(item)`, `pop()`, `peek()`, `is_empty()`

### 2. Queue (FIFO - First In First Out)
- **Description:** A collection where the first element added is the first to be removed.  
- **Operations:** `enqueue(item)`, `dequeue()`, `is_empty()`

### 3. Linked List
- **Description:** A linear data structure where elements are nodes connected by pointers.  
- **Operations:** `insert(data)`, `display()`

### 4. Binary Tree
- **Description:** A hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children.  
- **Traversal:** Inorder traversal implemented.

### 5. Graph (Adjacency List)
- **Description:** Represents relationships between nodes using adjacency lists.  
- **Operations:** `add_edge(u, v)`, `display()`

### How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.  
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/ifrahgedi/DataStructuresPython.git
